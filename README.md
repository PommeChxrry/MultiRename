# rename-file-project

A simple Python application that allows users to rename multiple files (images, documents...) based on various criteria.  
This tool is designed to be easy to use, with a clean interface and customizable renaming options.

## Features

- Select a folder and/or individual files
- The programm will display all files in creation date order
- Remove unwanted files before processing
- Choose between two renaming modes:
  - Random names (letters/numbers)
  - Custom names with sequential numbering
- A preview before renaming (old name â†’ new name)
- Keep original file properties (creation date, size, type)
- Visual feedback during the renaming process

## Notes

This is a personal project. It is a work in progress (unusable at the moment)
