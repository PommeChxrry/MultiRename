# Rename File Project

A simple Python application that allows users to rename multiple files (images, documents...) at once based on various criteria.  
This tool is designed to be easy to use, with a clean interface and customizable renaming options.

## Features

- Select one or more folders and/or individual files
- Choose between two renaming modes:
  - Random names (letters and numbers)
  - Custom names with sequential numbering
- Preview before renaming (old name â†’ new name)
- Preserve original file properties (creation date, size, type)

## Future Features

Planned improvements for upcoming versions:

- Allow users to remove unwanted files before starting the renaming process
- Add a visual progress indicator during file renaming
- Improve the preview display

## Notes

This is a personal project, currently under development.  
**It is not fully functional yet.**
